# Classification-for-Blood-Cells
 Classifying different types of blood cells and counting different blood cell are important indicators important for many diagnostic tests. Our task will use Keras and Sklearn to automatically classify 4 main types of subtype blood cells in each blood sample image and do some counting among them. Finally, we will use confusion matrix to see the modelsâ€™ performance and give some highlights on future work.
